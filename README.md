# Eat

## Building

## EatApi Submodule


For the first iteration the app will show you a list of “nearby restaurants” but currently there is just 1 dummy restaurant for demonstrative purposes.  The app also shows a navigation menu for the app and details of the selected restaurant i.e. description, menu, location, etc.  One thing we found to be difficult was dealing with location services to find actual nearby restaurants so that feature was put on ice for this iteration.  After the first iteration, we have a nice skeleton for our app and we hope to give it more functionality and real data in the following iterations.
